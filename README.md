# OpenRPG_Inventory
#### Hi! In this repository you will find a simple but powerful way to manage a simple and expandable inventory. Everything is commented and structured to be easy to learn.

## Inventory System
  - Comes with 29 functions (23 public and 6 private) that allows you to simply manage the inventory. 
  - Supports different types of items (consumable, equipment, material, quest, miscellaneous and loot). You can add your custom ones!
  - Items are identified by an ID, and the rest of the data is stored in a DataTable, so its very easy to add and modify items! 
  - Each item can execute custom logic when used, just overriding an event in its class.
