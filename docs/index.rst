OpenRPG: Inventory
==================

Overview
--------

Welcome to the OpenRPG Inventory system documentation! This **generic, modular** and **efficient** inventory system will allow you
to provide any actor you want with items container functionaly, not only for the player character, so you can have storages, sellers,
lootable monsters and much more sharing the same system under the hood.

It has been designed to be flexible enough to suit all your customization requeriments (item effects, containers behaivors) using
component inheritance to always construct from a base functionality and expand it as you like.

I will try my best to keep this documentation as well organized as possible, to help you understand every aspect of the system.

.. Hint:: If you like it dont forget to leave a star on `GitHub <https://github.com/angelhodar/OpenRPG_Inventory>`__
   and also it would be a huge help if you give me all your feedback about errors you find or some features that you would like to be implemented!
